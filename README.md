# Amazon Vine Analysis

## Overview 
The purpose of this project was to complete an analysis comparing music reviews of Amazon Vine Members vs non-Vine Members. The Amazon Vine Program allows for companies to pay a fee to Amazon, provide their product to Amazon Vine Members, who are then required to publish a review. The goal is to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine Members. The music dataset reviewed in this project can be found [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/tsv/amazon_reviews_us_Music_v1_00.tsv.gz). 

## Results
 * There is a total of 7 Vine Reviews and a total of 105,979 non-Vine Reviews. 
 * There are no five star reviews from Vine Members and a total of 67,580 five star reviews from non-Vine Members. 
 * Five star reviews form Vine Members represents 0% of the total Vine Member reviews. Five star reviews from non-vine members represent 63.8% of the total non-Vine Member reviews. 

## Summary 
There is no bias towards positive reviews from the Vine Program. In this dataset there are too few Vine Member reviews to come to a conclusion on if the membership program causes a disproportionate amount of positive reviews. 
One recommendation would be to expand the dataset to include more vine-member reviews and then re-run the same analysis completed above with a representative sample of Vine Members. This would allow for conclusions to be drawn on the possible bias of the paid review program.
